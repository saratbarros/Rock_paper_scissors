## About this project
- In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than
typing their answer in a prompt.
- For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
-  Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
- Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
- Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
